# Info

New and improved pogInChat, a web app that parses VODS

Save your favorite streamers vods for users to vote on the best moments

Paste in ids/urls from recent broadcasts [Twitch Channel](https://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon/videos)

If you are the first person to like a moment you become the "finder" all subsequent likes will be added to your rating.

View the browse page to look at the most recently liked moments across all videos ranked by the number of likes in the last 60 seconds, 30 minutes, day, week. 

The browse page also features the most liked videos and the highest rated users rank and rating. 

Styling is a WIP

# Bugs
Currently vercel deployment cannot fetch new videos due to the function timing out over 10 seconds, Heroku works fine.
